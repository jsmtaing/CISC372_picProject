# CISC372_hw3
Personal forked copy of the third assignment for CISC372.
The project consists of modifying a simple image convolution program that can load an image and apply a standard filter to that image.  The program will then output the results as a png image called "output.png".
Available filters are: edge detection, sharpen, blur, gaussian, emboss, identity.
